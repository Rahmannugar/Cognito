## 🗺️ Routes

All routes are centrally configured in `src/config/routes.tsx` with lazy loading for optimal performance.

| Path                           | Description           | Auth Required |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------- |
| `/`                            | Landing page          | No            |
| `/login`                       | User login            | No            |
| `/signup`                      | User registration     | No            |
| `/verify-otp`                  | OTP verification      | No            |
| `/forgot-password`             | Password reset        | No            |
| `/dashboard`                   | Main dashboard        | Yes           |
| `/classes`                     | All classes           | Yes           |
| `/teach-me`                    | Create topic class    | Yes           |
| `/teach-me/class/units`        | View class units      | Yes           |
| `/teach-me/session/:sessionId` | Active lesson session | Yes           |
| `*`                            | 404 Not Found page    | No            |
| `/settings`                    | User settings         | Yes           |

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. **Signup** → Email verification with OTP → Auto-login
2. **Login** → Email verification with OTP → Dashboard
3. **Password Reset** → OTP verification → Set new password → Login

All authentication uses JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies.

## 🎓 Learning Flow

1. **Create Class** - Choose Topic, YouTube, or PDF mode
2. **View Curriculum** - See AI-generated lesson units
3. **Start Lesson** - Begin interactive learning session
4. **Interact with Ajibade** - Ask questions, get clarifications
5. **Complete Quizzes** - Test your understanding
6. **Track Progress** - Monitor your learning journey

The frontend integrates with a RESTful API and a dedicated WebSocket server:

- **REST API**: Handles high-level orchestration (Auth, Class Creation, Profiles).
- **WebSocket (Lesson Session)**:
  - **Handshake**: Initiated with `sessionId` and JWT.
  - **Message Flow**: Synchronized via `NEXT_STEP`, `STEP_COMPLETED`, and `USER_QUESTION`.
  - **Audio Delivery**: Streaming `AUDIO_CHUNK` messages (Base64 OGG) for low-latency voice synthesis.
  - **YouTube Sync**: Pause-point synchronization via `YOUTUBE_STEP`.

See [FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](./FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for full message schemas.

## 🧪 Validation

All API requests are validated using Zod schemas before sending to ensure type safety and data integrity.

See `src/lib/validation/schemas.ts` for all validation schemas.

## 🏗️ Core Module Deep-Dive

### 📡 The Orchestration Layer (`src/lib/hooks/activity`)

This is the "brain" of the frontend. It manages the complex lifecycle of a lesson session:

- **`useLessonWebSocket`**: Orchestrates the duplex communication with the server, handling event routing for lesson steps, questions, and sync points.
- **`useAudioStreaming`**: Manages the `AudioContext` and chunked buffer strategy for the OGG/Opus stream, ensuring seamless playback without blocking the UI.

### 🔐 Infrastructure & Services (`src/lib/services`)

A robust communication layer that abstracts the backend complexity:

- **`apiClient`**: A customized Axios instance with global interceptors for header injection and automated error handling (e.g., recursive logout on session expiration).
- **Service SDKs**: Strongly typed methods for Auth, Class management, and User stats, ensuring the UI remains decoupled from API endpoints.

### 🧠 State Management Foundation (`src/lib/store`)

Uses **Zustand** for high-performance, atomic state updates:

- **`authStore`**: Manages user session lifecycle, persistence, and hydration.
- **`toastStore`**: A centralized notification system for consistent user feedback across async operations.

### 🎨 Design System (`src/components/ui`)

A collection of atomic, highly reusable components built on top of **Tailwind CSS**. These components are "dumb"—they focus purely on presentation and accessibility, ensuring a consistent visual language across the entire application.

### 🚀 Feature Modules (`src/components/features`)

Where the business logic meets the UI. Modules like `ajibade/` and `lesson/` integrate state and hooks to create complex interactive experiences, such as the AI Chat interface and the synchronized YouTube player.
